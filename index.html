            <p>I am a product specialist and administrative professional with 8+ years of experience in various sectors.
            </p>
            <p>Recognized for demonstrating independent discipline, flexibility, and a customer-oriented attitude, I
                have a verifiable history of contributing directly to company growth and expansion throughout my career.
                Professional focal points include sales, scheduling, data entry, web formatting, proofreading/editing,
                social media marketing, content management, cross-functional team leadership, complex problem-solving,
                and client relationship management.</p>
            <p>I was previously a Remote eCommerce Product Specialist for CopperSmith. Under my leadership, I promoted
                and sold products to existing and prospective customers. I also oversaw administrative functions and
                special projects using Magento, Zendesk Talk, and Google apps. In addition, I collaborated with senior
                staff and departmental managers to ensure that the companyâ€™s product support structure is driving the
                business forward with minimal expenditures. </p>
            <p>Prior to this I established a record of success with Astrologer: Coach Sonja Francis. As an adept remote
                administrative/social media assistant, I perform a variety of tasks to support smooth operations,
                including scheduling appointments; outlining, formatting, and editing blog posts; and managing customer
                responses. </p>
            <p>I am interested in learning about new opportunities and can be reached through this profile or by email:
